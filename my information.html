    <h1>Welcome! This is more information about me</h1>
    <h3>These are a couple things I like:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Music</li>
        <img src="/images/vinyl collection.jpeg" alt="Vinyl Collection" width="25%" height="auto"/>
        <p>I got into collecting vinyls over the last two or so years and have been obsessed with it ever since.
            I currently own 17 of them, 5 of which are full artists discographies (them belonging to Harry Styles and Melanie Martinez).
            I plan on obtaining more as the years go on, but for now this is what I have.
